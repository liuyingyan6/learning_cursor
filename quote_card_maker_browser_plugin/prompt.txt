I need to develop a Chrome browser extension for generating beautifully designed quote cards. The extension will be called "Quote Card Generator". The detailed requirements are as follows:  
# Basic Architecture Requirements  
- Develop the Chrome extension using the Manifest V3 specification  
  
# Core Functional Requirements  
1. Web Text Selection Feature  
- Implement a right-click menu option when text is selected on a webpage  
- When text is selected, a floating icon appears above the text; clicking it triggers the plugin menu  
  
2. Card Template System  
- Provide 3 different themed styles (minimalist, classic, modern)  
  
3. Card Style Customization  
- Background images: 3 preset options with custom background support. Can refer to card styles from WeChat Reading or Douban  
- Font Settings:  
  - 6 different font choices, fixed font size  
  - Font color auto-adjusts based on background to maintain design coherence  
- Layout Settings:  
  - Text alignment options  
  - Long selected texts should wrap properly  
  - Adaptive margins between the text block and the cardâ€™s theme/background edges  
  
4. Export Options  
- Support multiple image formats (PNG/JPG/WEBP)  
- Allow users to choose image export quality
